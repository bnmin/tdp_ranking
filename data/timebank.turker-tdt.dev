JERUSALEM (AP) _ Taking the stand in her own defense, a friend of Yitzhak Rabin's assassin said Friday that she regretted calling the prime minister a traitor and praying for his death.
Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, has pleaded innocent to charges that she failed to report Yigal Amir's plan to kill Rabin.
She took the stand for more than four hours Friday in a Tel Aviv magistrate's court.
Amir, 27, is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 assassination of Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace rally.
Newspaper reports have said Amir was infatuated with Har-Shefi and may have been trying to impress her by killing the prime minister.
Har-Shefi acknowledged she told police interrogators that Rabin was a traitor and that she prayed for him to have a heart attack and die.
She said Rabin's murder was ``a black stain on Israel,'' Israel radio and Israel army radio reported.
Har-Shefi said she heard Amir talk about killing Rabin but did not tell the police because she did not believe he was serious.
Instead, she turned to her community rabbi in the Jewish West Bank settlement of Beit El and told him about Amir's statements.
The rabbi said called the talk about killing Rabin `` nonsense,'' and said Jews are prohibited from killing one another, the radio reports said.
Har-Shefi described Amir as an ``original thinker,'' as well as delusional and a liar.
She also denied accusations made by Amir's brother, Hagai, that she joined an anti-Arab underground movement.
She said she gave the Amir brothers false information regarding the location of a weapons and ammunition cache when they asked her to help organize such a movement.

Despite the recent possibility of military conflict with Iraq, oil prices have been falling, that's because of a worldwide glut of oil.
Now with a diplomatic solution to the crisis seemingly at hand, get set for oil prices from the Brent north sea variety to light swede crude to fall further.
Oil prices have come down from the middle of October from a twenty-two dollar barrel level down to the fourteen dollars we 're seeing today.
that 's built up a heck of a momentum and that momentum will look to increase.
ah next up is that thirteen dollar a barrel level we saw in the winter of nineteen ninety-four.
Weakened oil prices have already made life easier for motorists at the gas pump.
Gas prices fell nearly two cents a gallon over the last two weeks.
That according to the Lundberg survey of ten thousand gas stations nationwide.

NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn woman who was watching her clothes dry in a laundromat was killed Thursday evening when two would-be robbers emptied their pistols into the store, the police said.
The men appeared in the store at 469 Vermont St. in Brownsville around 7:15 p.m., after the victim, Linda Sanders, 35, had finished her cleaning and was waiting for her clothes to dry, detectives said.
``It looks as though they panicked,'' a detective, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the robbers.
``They intended to rob the place.
There were four or five people inside, and they just started firing.''
Ms. Sanders was hit several times and was pronounced dead at the scene.
The other customers fled, and the police said it did not appear that anyone else was injured.
The men took no money from their victim or from the establishment, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a Police Department spokesman.
Victor Miranda, who lives in Ms. Sanders' apartment building at 405 Williams Ave., said the laundry machines in the building were removed a few years ago to make room for management offices.

The British government has formally called for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to be expelled from the multiparty peace talks on northern Ireland.
The move had been widely expected after northern Ireland police said they believe the IRA was behind two killings in Belfast last week.
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchell McLaughlin says the party will challenge the move by legal means if they have to.
We 're going to fight it.
And uh we 've already challenged , very strongly, the uh the terms in which this has been presented.
But we 're challenging it on the ground that uh the RUC uh have offered an opinion, and this opinion is going to be used as a mechanism for ejecting us from the talks, and uh that's a very serious.
Any decision to expel Sinn Fein must be agreed jointly by the governments of both Britain and the Irish Republic.
