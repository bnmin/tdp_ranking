ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Organization of African Unity said Friday it would investigate the Hutu-organized genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda nearly four years ago.
Foreign ministers of member-states meeting in the Ethiopian capital agreed to set up a seven-member panel to investigate who shot down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane on April 6, 1994.
The assassination touched off a murderous rampage by Hutu security forces and civilians, who slaughtered mainly Tutsis but also Hutus who favored reconciliation with the minority.
It also reignited the civil war.
The panel also will look at the exodus of about 2 million Rwanda Hutus to neighboring countries where they lived in U.N.-run refugee camps for 2 1/2 years.
The investigation will consider the role of ``internal and external forces prior to the genocide and subsequently, and the role of the United Nations and its agencies and the OAU before, during and after the genocide,'' the OAU said.
The panel will be based in Addis Ababa, and will finish its investigation within a year, it said.
It is to be funded by voluntary contributions from within and outside the continent.

MOSCOW (AP) _ Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed an economic cooperation plan Friday, and Yeltsin claimed they resolved even more nagging problems.
Russia and Ukraine share similar cultures and languages, and Ukraine was ruled from Moscow for centuries.
But while the two Slavic neighbors see themselves as natural partners, their relations since the breakup of the Soviet Union have been bedeviled by a number of disputes _ Black Sea naval bases, border problems and Ukraine's natural gas debts.
``We have covered the entire list of questions and discussed how we will be tackling them,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
``I must say there are no unsettled problems any more.
We have solved them all.''
But his sweeping statement contained no details, and gave no indication of how the disputes could be resolved.
Their solution would require a compromise between the two nations' parliaments.
A major dispute concerns a broad political treaty calling for border demarcation, which the two presidents signed last May.
In effect, the treaty amounts to Russian recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty and borders, and the Ukrainian parliament has already ratified it.
However, Russia has stalled ratification, trying to tie it to an agreement that would permit the Russian navy to use a naval base on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula for at least 20 more years.
In their joint statement issued after the talks, Yeltsin and Kuchma called for the fastest possible ratification of the treaty, saying it would create a ``strong legal foundation'' for bilateral ties and help stability in Europe.
Kuchma assured Yeltsin that Ukraine would not join NATO, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said, according to the Interfax news agency.
The Russian leadership has staunchly opposed the western alliance's expansion into Eastern Europe.
In their joint statement, released by the Kremlin, the two leaders also pledged to consult each other regularly on their approaches to relations with NATO and, in particular, their action within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace program.
Last year, Russian officials assailed Ukraine for holding joint naval exercises with NATO in the Black Sea _ an area Moscow considers its own turf.
Kuchma has said repeatedly that Ukraine would remain neutral for the foreseeable future.
Yeltsin and Kuchma also called for developing the stagnant relations between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics.
In the past, Russia has often claimed that Ukraine was undermining efforts at closer cooperation within the CIS.
A major goal of Kuchma's four-day state visit was the signing of a 10-year economic program aimed at doubling the two nations' trade turnover, which fell to dlrs 14 billion last year, down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996.
The two presidents on Friday signed the plan, which calls for cooperation in the metallurgy, fuel, energy, aircraft building, missile, space and chemical industries.
A major project is joint manufacturing of An-70 cargo planes, the Kremlin statement said.
The program also calls for coordination of economic reforms and joint improvement of social programs in the two countries, where many people have become impoverished during the chaotic post-Soviet transition to capitalism.
Kuchma also planned to visit Russian gas giant Gazprom, most likely to discuss Ukraine's dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company.

ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Some 1,500 ethnic Albanians marched Sunday in downtown Istanbul, burning Serbian flags to protest the killings of ethnic Albanians by Serb police in southern Serb Kosovo province.
The police barred the crowd from reaching the Yugoslavian consulate in downtown Istanbul, but allowed them to demonstrate on nearby streets.
`` Stop the bloodshed in Kosovo,'' the protesters chanted.
Meanwhile in the capital, Ankara, a few hundred ethnic Albanians laid a black wreath at the gate of Yugoslavian embassy.
Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population in Kosovo, but Serbs maintain control through a large military and police presence.
Serbian police say they are trying to eliminate the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army and restore order.
At least 51 people were reported killed in clashes between Serb police and ethnic Albanians in the troubled region in recent days.
Turkey, worried about civil war in Kosovo spilling to the whole Balkans, urged all Balkan states to sign a joint declaration that the Kosovo crisis be solved peacefully and without any change of borders.
Turks feel they have special ties to the whole region, which they ruled for hundreds of years during the Ottoman Empire.
They also share Islam with the ethnic Albanians.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Tired of being sidelined, Hungarian astronaut Bertalan Farkas is leaving for the United States to start a new career, he said Saturday.
``Being 48 is too early to be retired,'' a fit-looking Farkas said on state TV's morning talk show.
With American astronaut Jon McBride, Farkas set up an American-Hungarian joint venture called Orion 1980, manufacturing space-travel related technology.
Farkas will move to the company's U.S. headquarters.
Farkas, an air force captain, was sent into space on board the Soyuz 36 on May 26, 1980.
He spent six days aboard the Salyut 6 spacecraft with three Soviet astronauts, Valery Kubasov, Leonid Popov and Valery Riumin.
McBride, 54, of Lewisburg, West Virginia, was part of a seven-member crew aboard the Orbiter Challenger in October 1984 and later served as assistant administrator for congressional relations for NASA.
Farkas expressed the hope he one day follow in the footsteps of fellow astronaut John Glenn, who at 77 is about to go into space again.
On May 22, 1995, Farkas was made a brigadier general, and the following year he was appointed military attache at the Hungarian embassy in Washington.
However , cited by District of Columbia traffic police in December for driving under the influence of alcohol, Farkas was ordered home and retired.

President Clinton says he is committed to a possible strike against Iraq, despite objections from other countries.
Steve Hurst has that.
The US military buildup in the Persian gulf continues apace, more planes headed from the united states and senior officials say Iraq's president Saddam Hussein can expect punishing air strikes to continue well into the future if he does n't stop building biological and chemical weapons.
Saddam will know by our actions and our warning that we will be prepared to act again if we have evidence he is trying to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction capabilities.
In a bit of television diplomacy, Iraq's deputy foreign minister responded from Baghdad in less than one hour, saying Washington would break international law by attacking without UN approval.
The united states is not authorized to use force before going to the council.
President Clinton, meantime, glossed over stern warnings from Moscow on Thursday that US air strikes against Iraq could do serious harm to relations with the Kremlin.
We're trying to find a diplomatic solution.
And I hope that, whatever happens today, that our relationships with Russia will continue to be productive and constructive and strong, because that's very important to the future of our peoples.
One contrary view of the issue presented itself to the president as he arrived in Philadelphia later in the day.
Nevertheless, the president said Washington would use force if diplomacy fails to force Saddam Hussein to back down.
The Russian foreign minister, meanwhile , sought to soften the harsh words of his military counterpart, saying on Friday that Russia now feels the US must hold off at least until UN secretary general Kofi Annan visits Baghdad in a last-ditch effort at diplomacy.
Annan has no trip planned so far.
Meanwhile, secretary of state Madeleine Albright, Berger and defense secretary William Cohen announced plans to travel to an unnamed city in the US heartland next week, to explain to the American people just why military force will be necessary if diplomacy fails.
Steve Hurst, CNN, the state department.

CAGUAS, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Kidnappers kept their promise to kill a store owner they took hostage and police found the man's dismembered and decapitated body Friday wrapped in plastic garbage bags.
Police confirmed Friday that the body found along a highway in this municipality 15 miles south of San Juan belonged to Jorge Hernandez, 49.
Hernandez was kidnapped from his small, neighborhood store in the town of Trujillo Alto at 10 p.m. Wednesday, police said.
His kidnappers demanded a ransom of dlrs 1 million, but negotiations broke off at noon Thursday.
Police gave no details about the negotiations with the kidnappers for the return of Hernandez.
The store owner's body was found with the arms and head cut off and the parts stuffed in separate garbage bags.
A passerby called police to report the body alongside the road.
Puerto Rico Police Superintendent Pedro Toledo urged people who might be targeted by kidnappers to be alert.
``There has been an increase in Puerto Rico in this kind of thing and some of these bands of kidnappers are made up of foreigners,'' Toledo said.
While some Latin American countries such as Mexico and Colombia have suffered from a rash of kidnappings in recent years, the crime has not been common in this U.S. commonwealth.

NEWARK, N.J. _ A new Essex County task force began delving Thursday into the slayings of 14 black women over the last five years in the Newark area, as law-enforcement officials acknowledged that they needed to work harder to solve the cases of murdered women.
The police and prosecutors said they had identified different suspects in six of the cases and had yet to find any pattern linking the killings or the victims, several of whom were believed to be prostitutes.
State, county and local law-enforcement officials have expressed concerns in recent months about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases.
Citing an example, Sgt. Derek Glenn, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, said that of nine women who had been killed last year, suspects had been arrested in only four cases.
But over all, arrests were made in more than 60 percent of murder cases, he said.
Eight of the 14 killings since 1993 were already under investigation by the Newark Police Department, Glenn said.
Of the eight victims, three were stabbed, two were strangled, two were beaten to death and one was asphyxiated, he said, and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem to indicate that the eight cases are not related.
But with the task-force investigation just getting under way, officials have been careful not to draw any firm conclusions, leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases.
There have been no arrests in any of the slayings.
``I have n't seen a pattern yet , '' said Patricia Hurt, the Essex County prosecutor, who created the task force on Tuesday.
``The type of lifestyle these women have is extremely dangerous,'' she said.

Former savings and loan chief, Charles Keating, is facing more legal troubles in California.
A federal appeals court has reinstated his state convictions for securities fraud.
NPR's Elaine Corey has more from San Francisco.
In nineteen ninety-one Charles Keating was convicted in state court of helping to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk junk bonds sold by Keating's employees at Lincoln savings and loan.
The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized by government regulators.
Keating's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a technicality.
And on that basis Keating was released from prison before he was eligible for parole.
Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled that the original appeal was flawed since it brought up issues that had not been raised before.
That means the convictions stand, a ruling likely to send Keating's lawyers back to state court where they must start over with a new appeal.
Elaine Corey, NPR news, San Francisco.

For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC news room in London.
More heavy gunfire in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
It's the second day of an offensive by the security forces against villages populated by ethnic Albanians.
BBC correspondent Karyn Coleman reports from Kosovo.
There were more accounts of people fleeing from the villages near where the offensive was taking place.
They were too afraid to stay, fearing the forces may also move their operations further afield.
By mid afternoon, official Serb sources were saying the operation was over, but that has not yet been confirmed from Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, which is where the whole attack is thought to have been planned.
The ethnic Albanians here in Kosovo are considerably worried about the future and fear they are witnessing the beginnings of a much wider conflict.
